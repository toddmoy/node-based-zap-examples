## Comparison

Here are some keys that _seem_ similar between current zap exports and ZDL 0.2. At this time, don't assume similar sounding things are definitely the same.

| 0.2               | Export            | Notes                                                   |

| -                 | root_id           | Usage of `id` in 0.2 might render this unnecessary?     |

| action            | action            | Meaning might slightly differ. See `series_skip_errors` |
| app               | selected_api      |                                                         |

| steps             | nodes             | Steps are an array, nodes are a hash                    |
| type              | type_of           |                                                         |
